# RewindPS4

## Introduction

This tool creates a proxy server that allows your PS console to connect and download specific versions of PS4 games, effectively enabling game downgrading. Due to game updates, some content may change over time. This tool allows you to play older versions of games.

#### Important Notes

1. This program works for downloading PS4 games on both PS4 and PS5 consoles. It does **NOT** work for PS5 games.
2. This program is **NOT** a jailbreak method. You do not need to modify your console in any way.
